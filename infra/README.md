# Nektron Moments AWS foundation

This directory defines the small, independent Nektron Moments AWS stack. It is
safe to package without contacting the database or reading application secrets.
Nothing here deploys automatically.

Production enrichment was explicitly authorized to resume on 2026-09-21.
The API enrichment gate, single-message SQS worker and due-job retry schedule
are enabled in the deployment source. The $230 monthly scene-description cap,
100,000-call ceiling, 1,000 geocode-call limit and worker concurrency of one
are unchanged. General maintenance schedules remain disabled.

## What the stack creates

- A Python 3.12 Lambda behind an API Gateway HTTP API. `GET /v1/health` is
  protected by the Cognito JWT authorizer.
- A Cognito email/password user pool and public native-app client. MFA is off;
  email confirmation uses one code, refresh tokens last 365 days, and messages
  use `Nektron Moments <info@nektron.ai>` after deploying this rename, retaining
  the same verified SES identity.
- One private, SSE-S3 media bucket. Incomplete multipart uploads expire after
  seven days, Local-mode staging objects after one day, and trash after 30 days.
  Remote originals transition to S3 Intelligent-Tiering.
- One encrypted processing queue plus a 14-day dead-letter queue. A bounded
  worker consumes one message at a time with one reserved concurrent Lambda
  execution. Individual message failures are returned to SQS for retry and
  move to the dead-letter queue after eight receives.
- Retry, reconciliation, quota-reset, and trash-purge EventBridge rules. Only
  `RetryDueJobs` is **enabled by default** to recover a durable MySQL job after
  a lost or early SQS delivery. The other three rules remain disabled.
- A tag-filtered monthly AWS budget, defaulting to USD 50. An email subscriber
  is managed in place after deployment when `--budget-email` is supplied to
  the release helper, avoiding replacement of the existing named budget.

The stack deliberately has no VPC attachment, NAT gateway, new database, RDS
Proxy, ECS service, load balancer, CDN, vector database, or SageMaker endpoint.
The Phase 1 API reaches only the existing `ImageTracker` database using its
dedicated credential and the bundled Amazon RDS regional CA.

## Application-code boundary

The handler is owned by [`../services/api`](../services/api), not by the
infrastructure project. Serverless resolves handlers relative to its service
directory, so `scripts/stage_service.py` creates an ignored `.build` directory
containing the full shared `services` package:

```text
.build/
  serverless.yml
  location_normalization_rules.json
  services/
```

The packaged handlers are `services/api/handler.handler` and
`services/worker/handler.handler`. Runtime Python packages are declared in
`services/api/requirements.txt` and installed into the staging directory. The
root-level location-normalization rules are staged at the Lambda task root so
both local and deployed processing use the same address corrections. No
duplicate service implementation is maintained here.

## Bounded reverse geocoding

GPS reverse-geocoding is asynchronous and demand-driven. A manifest creates a
location enrichment job; the SQS worker sends only latitude and longitude to
Amazon Location Service Places V2, never the photo or video. `ReverseGeocode`
sets `IntendedUse=Storage`, `MaxResults=1`, and filters to address-oriented place
types because Nektron Moments permanently stores and searches the result. Durable
rows use provider identifier `AmazonLocationPlacesV2`. Nearby coordinates reuse
a stored result within 5 metres before any provider call is made. Provider
calls are capped at 1,000 per user per month, while the worker's concurrency of
one prevents a scan from producing an uncontrolled request burst. At the
2026-08-28 `us-east-2` list price of USD 4 per 1,000 stored reverse-geocode
requests, the default ceiling bounds this component to about USD 4 per user per
month. No new always-on compute service is introduced.

The production controls are
`NEKTRON_MOMENTS_GEOCODE_REUSE_RADIUS_METERS=5` and
`NEKTRON_MOMENTS_GEOCODE_MONTHLY_CALL_LIMIT=1000`. The Lambda execution role grants
only `geo-places:ReverseGeocode`, scoped to the regional
`provider/default` resource.

Scene descriptions use `gpt-5.6-terra` with high-detail, 1024-pixel previews,
Flex processing, a 100,000-request safety ceiling, and a harder USD 230
per-user monthly ceiling. Before staging, MySQL atomically reserves one request
and USD 0.010. After a provider attempt, the worker charges sanitized usage at
USD 2.00/M ordinary input tokens, USD 0.20/M cached input tokens, and USD
12.00/M output tokens; a missing usage report or called-provider failure is
charged the conservative reservation. Local originals remain on-device; only
metadata-free temporary JPEG previews enter the one-day staging prefix.

Geocode jobs use the Lambda execution role rather than a provider key. The
worker lazily reads `/imagetracker/<stage>/openai` only for description jobs, so
an unavailable OpenAI credential does not prevent Amazon Location jobs from
being composed. It uses the same MySQL secret and bundled Amazon RDS CA as the
API. Partial SQS batch responses are enabled with a batch size of one so
transient failures are retried without acknowledging the message.

## Credential-free validation

From this directory on Windows or WSL:

```bash
python scripts/validate_foundation.py --stage prod
python scripts/stage_service.py
```

The first command checks cost and architecture guardrails without AWS access.
The second verifies and stages the shared handler without installing anything.

Full Serverless validation requires Node.js, npm, and Python with pip. The build
installs CPython 3.12 `manylinux2014_x86_64` wheels explicitly, so it remains
reproducible when WSL's host interpreter advances beyond Lambda's version. The
intended environment is WSL Ubuntu because it already holds the project's AWS
credentials:

```bash
cd /mnt/c/Development/Projects/NektronMoments/infra
npm ci
npm run validate
npm run package
```

`npm run package` produces CloudFormation and Lambda artifacts under
`.build/.serverless`; it does not deploy them. Review those artifacts before the
first deployment, then run the credential-free artifact assertions:

```bash
python scripts/validate_foundation.py --stage prod \
  --packaged-template .build/.serverless/cloudformation-template-update-stack.json
```

The deploy script calls `scripts/deploy_packaged.py` after validation. That
helper passes absolute config and package paths to Serverless, avoiding its
different relative-path behavior between package, deploy, and post-deploy
hooks.

## Configuration and deployment

Use a short lowercase stage name containing only letters, numbers, and hyphens.
Bucket names include the stage, AWS account ID, and region; the remaining
resources are stage- and account-scoped.

The runtime is given SSM **parameter names**, not resolved secret values. Create
these SecureString parameters through the normal AWS administration flow before
enabling database or provider functionality:

```text
/imagetracker/<stage>/mysql
/imagetracker/<stage>/openai
/imagetracker/<stage>/elevenlabs
```

The DSN must select only the existing `ImageTracker` database. Do not reuse a
connection string whose default database is another DeepTrading schema.

For `prod`, `/imagetracker/prod/openai` has been provisioned. Amazon Location
Service Places V2 uses IAM authentication and has no additional SSM
prerequisite. Review the packaged policy to confirm the worker has only the
required reverse-geocode permission, and verify that requests retain
`IntendedUse=Storage`. Provider values must never be placed in tracked `.env`
files, Serverless parameters, CloudFormation output, or shell history.

Before deploying this build, preview and apply the additive migrations:

```bash
cd /mnt/c/Development/Projects/NektronMoments
./scripts/migrate-db.sh
./scripts/migrate-db.sh --apply
./scripts/db-smoke.sh
./scripts/bulk-db-canary.sh
```

Migration 012 adds the provider circuit columns, migration 013 widens
international provider/address fields, and migration 014 creates the durable
bulk-manifest import, raw staging, asset-work, and failure tables plus an online
occurrence lookup index. The wrapper refuses a non-`ImageTracker` database and
reconciles DDL that committed before its ledger marker. The earlier table-
rewriting ALTERs still require processing to be idle; migration 014 uses
replay-safe `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` statements and a `LOCK=NONE` index, so
queued enrichment jobs do not block that additive rollout.

After migration 014 is present, preview the dedicated bulk database canary and
then opt into its self-cleaning synthetic write:

```bash
./scripts/bulk-db-canary.sh
./scripts/bulk-db-canary.sh --apply
```

The canary uses only the application SSM MySQL credential. It refuses anything
other than one active account and a fresh UUID-prefixed synthetic Local source,
uses four no-GPS `.nef` rows so no provider work or uploads are created, and
rolls back cleanup rather than broadening beyond its exact IDs and hashes. It
does not accept a source argument and cannot target `My Photos`.

Bulk manifests use the existing private media bucket under `manifests/input/`
and `manifests/result/`, plus a dedicated encrypted queue, dead-letter queue,
five-minute recovery rule, and one-concurrent Lambda (1,024 MiB, 2 GiB `/tmp`,
15-minute timeout). Inputs expire after seven days. Result artifacts are kept
because they are the durable client-reconciliation source after the large
staging rows are purged; they contain metadata identities and outcomes, never
original photo/video bytes. A later explicit client-ack cleanup can replace
that retention policy without weakening offline resume safety.

After schema verification, deployment is explicit. CloudFormation parameters
are rendered during packaging; the budget subscriber is updated in place after
the stack succeeds:

```bash
npm run deploy -- --budget-email info@nektron.ai
```

The authorized enrichment rollout enables the general enrichment event-source
mapping and `RetryDueJobs` rule, and sets
`NEKTRON_MOMENTS_ENRICHMENT_PROCESSING_ENABLED=true`. The manifest-import worker
and its recovery rule remain enabled. An emergency pause should disable all
three enrichment controls together; the API pause rejects preparation before
creating jobs or provider reservations. Pausing does not cancel a provider call
that has already started.

Other supported parameters are:

- `monthlyBudgetUsd` (default `50`)
- `allowedOrigin` (default `*`; native clients do not depend on browser CORS)
- `retryScheduleState` (default `ENABLED` for enrichment recovery)
- `manifestImportRetryScheduleState` (`ENABLED` for bulk-import recovery)
- `maintenanceSchedulesState` (`DISABLED` for deferred maintenance jobs)

AWS cost-allocation tags `Application` and `Environment` must be activated in
Billing once before the tag-filtered budget can report complete costs. Stack
resources use `Application=ImageTracker`, `Product=NektronAI`, the deployment
stage, and `ManagedBy=ServerlessFramework`.

The S3 bucket and Cognito user pool use CloudFormation retention policies. A
stack removal therefore does not destroy user media or accounts; retained
resources must be reviewed and removed separately when intentionally retiring a
stage.
