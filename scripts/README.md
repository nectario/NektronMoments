# Nektron Moments shell toolkit

These Bash scripts are intended for WSL Ubuntu and resolve the repository root
without depending on the caller's working directory.

Start with:

```bash
cd /mnt/c/Development/Projects/NektronMoments
./scripts/play.sh help
./scripts/play.sh check
```

Individual commands:

```bash
./scripts/setup.sh
./scripts/cli.sh
./scripts/cli.sh doctor --json
./scripts/cli.sh sync "My Photos"
./scripts/cli.sh sync "My Photos" --transport bulk
./scripts/cli.sh sync "My Photos" --transport bulk --bulk-max-rows 1000
./scripts/cli.sh sync "My Photos" --transport batch
./scripts/cli.sh enrich "My Photos" --limit 64
./scripts/test.sh
./scripts/api-smoke.sh
./scripts/aws-smoke.sh
./scripts/db-smoke.sh
./scripts/bulk-db-canary.sh
./scripts/bulk-db-canary.sh --apply
./scripts/package-infra.sh
./scripts/store-openai-key.sh
./scripts/migrate-db.sh
./scripts/migrate-db.sh --apply
./scripts/mysql-one-file-import.sh "My Photos"
./scripts/mysql-one-file-import.sh "My Photos" --apply \
  --admin-env-file /path/to/ignored/.env.prod
```

`sync` creates no enrichment jobs unless `--with-enrichment` is supplied.
Use `enrich --limit N` to explicitly prepare bounded location and scene jobs,
then stage the returned scene previews without rescanning the source or sending
queued manifests. If production enrichment is paused, it fails before creating
jobs. Both commands are resumable; stopping with `Ctrl+C` leaves completed work
saved.

`sync --transport auto` uses one asynchronous import above 10 batches or 1,000
eligible rows. `bulk` requests that path explicitly, while `batch` is the safe
escape hatch for small deltas, deletions, pending hashes, or a terminal bulk
failure. A submitted server import is never raced by batch delivery.
Use `--bulk-max-rows 1000` or `10000` for staged production rollout; the CLI
finishes that segment and leaves the remaining batches saved for the next run.

Safety boundaries:

- `aws-smoke.sh` performs read-only CloudFormation queries and expects the
  unauthenticated API health request to return HTTP 401.
- `db-smoke.sh` retrieves the dedicated application credential from SSM in
  memory and opens an explicitly read-only transaction. It prints counts only.
- `bulk-db-canary.sh` is a WSL-only, self-cleaning acceptance test for the
  set-based MySQL importer. It is read-only by default. `--apply` requires
  migration 014, exactly one active account, the SSM-scoped Nektron Moments app
  credential, and an empty UUID-prefixed synthetic target. It imports exactly
  four no-GPS `.nef` metadata rows, verifies two assets, three occurrences, one
  rejected row, zero jobs/locations/uploads, and terminal redelivery safety,
  then deletes only those exact synthetic public IDs, hashes, and source keys
  in an assertion-guarded transaction. It never accepts or targets `My Photos`.
- `package-infra.sh` builds ignored `.build` output and never deploys it.
- `store-openai-key.sh` copies a non-empty `OPENAI_API_KEY` from the current
  WSL process into the ignored repository `.env` without displaying it. It does
  not create or update an AWS SSM parameter.
- `migrate-db.sh` is the narrowly scoped schema write command. Without
  `--apply` it reports the 012–014 plan only. With `--apply`, the older table-
  rewriting ALTERs require an idle processing database; migration 014 uses
  replay-safe table creation and a `LOCK=NONE` index. Every migration reconciles
  a missing ledger row after an interrupted DDL.
- `mysql-one-file-import.sh` builds one complete CSV for a Local source.
  Without `--apply` it only reports the ignored local file. With `--apply` it
  requires an empty manifest outbox, loads that single file into a temporary
  MySQL table with `LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE`, inserts only missing pending-hash
  occurrences and their change rows set-wise, and commits once. Use
  `--admin-env-file` when the normal app credential deliberately lacks
  temporary-table privileges; values are loaded in memory and never printed.
- No script invokes `NektronMoments.py`, `tag_location.py`, or `serverless deploy`.

Override defaults only when intentionally checking another environment:

```bash
NEKTRON_MOMENTS_AWS_REGION=us-east-2 \
NEKTRON_MOMENTS_STACK_NAME=image-tracker-prod \
NEKTRON_MOMENTS_DB_SECRET_PARAMETER=/imagetracker/prod/mysql \
./scripts/play.sh check
```
